<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am currently a  <a href="https://shorturl.at/kpquU">Distinguished Postdoctoral Researcher</a> at Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, hosted by <a href="https://jonathan-ullman.github.io/">Jonathan Ullman‬</a>. I also work closely with <a href="https://www.bu.edu/cs/profiles/adam-smith/">Adam Smith‬</a>.</p>
<p>In August 2023, I completed my PhD at University of Toronto and Vector Institute‬ where I was fortunate to be advised by  <a href="http://danroy.org/">‪Daniel M. Roy‬</a>. I also received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology.</p>
<p>My research focuses broadly on the theoretical foundations of trustworthy machine learning, and in particular, <b>Privacy</b>, <b>Generalization</b>, and <b>Memorization</b>. Recognitions of my work include a <b>Best Paper Award at ICML 2024</b>, the MITACS Accelerate Fellowship, the Doctoral Completion Award, as well as several honors for graduate research excellence, including the Henderson and Bassett Research Fellowship and the Viola Carless Smith Research Fellowship. Additionally, I was recognized as a top reviewer at NeurIPS in 2021 and 2023.</p>
<h2>Internships and Research Visits</h2>
<p>During Summer and Fall 2022‪, I was a research intern at Google Brain (Differential Privacy Team) where I was extremely lucky to be mentored by <a href="http://www.thomas-steinke.net/">Thomas Steinke</a>  and <a href="https://athakurta.squarespace.com/">Abhradeep Guha Thakurta‬</a>. 
I was also a research intern at <a href="https://www.elementai.com/">Element AI‬ (ServiceNow Research Lab)</a> in Winter 2019 and Fall 2020 where I had the privilege of working with <a href="https://gkdz.org/">Gintare Karolina Dziugaite</a> in the Trustworthy AI Research Program. In early 2020, I had the opportunity to visit the <a href="https://www.ias.edu/">Institute of Advanced Studies</a> at Princeton as a visiting student for the special year program on optimization, statistics, and theoretical machine learning.</p>
<h2>Contact Me!</h2>
<p>Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss research ideas. Also, I'm happy to offer guidance and support to those applying to graduate programs, especially individuals who might not typically have access to such assistance</p>
